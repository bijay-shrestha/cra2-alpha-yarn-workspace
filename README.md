This project is a playground for using create-react-app 2 alpha release with Yarn workspace. This support was reverted
before CRA2 GA. 

To run do the following:
- Run `yarn` from the workspace root (or any app or package folder should work also).
- Run `yarn start` from the root to start the app. 
- Run `yarn build` to build production version.

If you change anything in `packages/wp-core/components/Hello/index.js` and save the change will show in the browser.
